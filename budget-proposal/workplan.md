# Operating Budget Workplan

## Phase 1 – Orientation & Scope
- Confirm fiscal year, reporting audience, submission deadline.
- Identify decision criteria (break-even, service levels, compliance thresholds).
- Document existing commitments (facility offers, staffing expectations, city support).

## Phase 2 – Baseline Assumptions
- Establish key drivers: enrollment capacity, days open, fee structure, subsidy rates.
- Define inflation, COLA, and benefits load assumptions.
- Capture placeholder values where data is pending; flag each for later verification.

## Phase 3 – Program & Service Model
- List program offerings (after-school care, enrichment, meals, transportation).
- Set service ratios (youth per staff, program hours, seasonal variations).
- Determine participation tiers (full pay, subsidized, scholarship).

## Phase 4 – Revenue Planning
- Forecast earned revenue: membership dues, program fees, grants, city allocation.
- Map restricted vs unrestricted funding streams.
- Schedule revenue timing (monthly/quarterly) for cash flow modeling.

## Phase 5 – Expense Planning
- Personnel costs: salaries, wages, taxes, benefits, stipends.
- Program costs: curriculum, meals, supplies, transportation, events.
- Facility costs: rent/lease, utilities, maintenance, insurance.
- Administrative costs: technology, finance, legal, compliance, marketing.
- Build contingency reserves and depreciation schedules where applicable.

## Phase 6 – Staffing Plan Integration
- Align staffing levels with program ratios and operating hours.
- Incorporate full-time, part-time, seasonal, volunteer roles.
- Apply overtime, shift differentials, and relief coverage assumptions.

## Phase 7 – Facilities & Capital Needs
- Document space requirements, equipment, and capital improvements.
- Schedule capital expenditures and funding sources.
- Coordinate with city asset management for in-kind support.

## Phase 8 – Cash Flow & Sustainability
- Build 12-month cash flow projection using revenue/expense schedule.
- Assess working capital needs and minimum cash thresholds.
- Model scenario sensitivities (enrollment drop, grant delays, cost overruns).

## Phase 9 – Draft Budget Package
- Compile summary P&L, staffing table, capital plan, cash flow statements.
- Write narrative explaining assumptions, community impact, risk mitigations.
- Prepare presentation-ready charts/tables for city leadership review.

## Phase 10 – Review & Implementation Plan
- Validate figures with stakeholders; replace placeholders with actuals.
- Document monitoring cadence (monthly variance reports, dashboard).
- Outline implementation milestones leading to program launch.
