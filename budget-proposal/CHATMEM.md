## Current Focus
- Build operating budget tooling for Fairbanks after-school program reboot.
- Draft narrative and documentation to guide Matthew through CFO-style process.
- Populate Excel workbook scaffold with assumptions, revenue/expense placeholders, and scenario modeling.

## Key Artifacts
- `README.md`: role, tone, directives for CFO-guided support.
- `workplan.md`: 10-phase roadmap plus data/artifact checklist.
- `workbook-structure.md`: sheet-by-sheet design notes.
- `op-budget-budget.xlsx`: working model with named assumptions, staffing links, revenue/expense tables, cash flow, scenarios.
- `intake-questionnaire.md`: discovery checklist for data gathering.
- `narrative-overview.md`: plain-language explanation of the budgeting journey.

## Next Actions
- Gather real inputs (fiscal year confirmation, fee schedule, city subsidy, facility/insurance quotes).
- Replace placeholders in `Assumptions`, `Revenue Forecast`, and `Expense Detail` sheets.
- Flesh out staffing compensation rates and align personnel counts with enrollment plan.
- Draft executive summary and presentation artifacts once numbers stabilize.
