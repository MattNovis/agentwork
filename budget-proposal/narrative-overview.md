# What We're Building (Kid-Friendly Guide)

Imagine we're opening the coolest after-school clubhouse in Fairbanks. We want the city to trust us with money so we can keep the lights on, hire awesome mentors, and feed everyone a good snack. To earn that trust, we need a plan that shows where every dollar will come from and where it will go. That's called an *operating budget*.

## Step 1 – Understand the Mission
We start by asking: Who are we helping? How many kids will show up? What do they need every day (rides, homework help, food, games)? This is like drawing the blueprint for our clubhouse so nothing surprises us later.

## Step 2 – Gather the Facts
We collect the "puzzle pieces" that fill in the budget:
- How much the city might chip in.
- What families can pay (even if it's a small fee).
- What grants or donations might support us.
- How much it costs to run the building, pay staff, feed everyone, and keep things safe.

If we don't know a number yet, we use a placeholder and put a sticky note on it so we remember to swap in the real number later.

## Step 3 – Build the Money Map
Using a spreadsheet, we map out the year month-by-month so we can see:
- Money coming in (fees, city support, grants).
- Money going out (staff, supplies, rent, insurance, buses, snacks).
- If we ever run low on cash so we can adjust the plan before it becomes a problem.

## Step 4 – Stress-Test the Plan
We imagine different futures:
- **Base case:** what we think will happen.
- **Rainy day:** if fewer kids enroll or grants arrive late.
- **Sunny day:** if more support shows up.

This helps city leaders feel confident we're ready for curveballs.

## Step 5 – Share the Story
We turn the spreadsheets into an easy-to-read summary: charts, key numbers, and a story about how the clubhouse helps families. That way the Mayor, City Council, and partners see that every dollar creates real community value.

## Why This Matters
Families in Fairbanks lost their club once. We're making sure that when we reopen, we run it like pros: transparent, responsible, and ready for growth. This plan isn't just paperwork—it keeps the doors open and kids cared for.
