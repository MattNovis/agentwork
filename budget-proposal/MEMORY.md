## Current Status

**Project State:** 🟡 Initial setup phase

**What's Working:**
- ✅ Branch created and ready
- ✅ Folder structure in place
- ✅ Memory file initialized

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Define budget proposal requirements
- [ ] Identify input data sources (CSV, Excel, etc.)
- [ ] Create Python scripts for budget calculations
- [ ] Generate budget proposal output format

---

## Project Requirements

**To Be Defined:**
- Budget data sources
- Required calculations
- Output format preferences
- Reporting requirements
- Approval workflow (if any)

---

## Technical Notes

**Environment:**
- Working Directory: `/Users/mattnovis/agentwork`
- Project Folder: `budget-proposal/`
- Git Branch: `budget-proposal`
- Python Virtual Environment: Activate with `aw` alias or `source venv/bin/activate`

**Available Commands:**
```bash
aw                          # Activate virtual environment
cd budget-proposal          # Navigate to project folder
python3 script.py           # Run Python scripts
```

## Questions & Decisions

**Open Questions:**
- What type of budget proposal? (departmental, project, annual, etc.)
- What data sources are available?
- What is the desired output format?
- Are there templates or formats to follow?

**Decisions Made:**
- Using git branch workflow for project isolation
- Storing project files in dedicated folder

---

## Important Notes

1. **Branch Workflow:** This project lives on the `budget-proposal` branch, separate from main
2. **Virtual Environment:** Remember to activate venv before running Python scripts
3. **Git Commits:** Commit changes regularly to track progress
4. **Documentation:** Update this MEMORY.md file as the project evolves
